# Ubuntu Server Installation on Proxmox VE

## Overview

This document outlines the deployment and initial configuration of an Ubuntu Server virtual machine within Proxmox Virtual Environment (VE). The Ubuntu Server VM provides a Linux environment for future self-hosted applications, server administration practice, and additional homelab services.

---

# Objectives

* Deploy Ubuntu Server as a virtual machine in Proxmox VE
* Configure virtual hardware resources
* Install Ubuntu Server LTS
* Configure networking
* Enable remote administration with OpenSSH
* Update the operating system
* Verify successful installation and connectivity

# Ubuntu Server Installation

Power on the virtual machine and complete the Ubuntu Server installation.

Configuration used during installation:

| Setting               | Value                               |
| --------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| Language              | English                             |
| Keyboard Layout       | English (US)                        |
| Installation Type     | Ubuntu Server                       |
| Network Configuration | DHCP                                |
| Storage Layout        | Guided Storage                      |
| Hostname              | ubuntu-server                       |
| Administrative User   | *aidan*                             |
| OpenSSH Server        | Installed                           |

After the installation completed, the virtual machine rebooted into the newly installed operating system.

# System Updates

Update the package repository:

```bash
sudo apt update
```

Upgrade installed packages:

```bash
sudo apt upgrade -y
```

Remove unnecessary packages:

```bash
sudo apt autoremove -y
```

---

# Network Verification

Verify the assigned IP address:

```bash
ip address
```

View routing information:

```bash
ip route
```

Verify DNS configuration:

```bash
cat /etc/resolv.conf
```

Test Internet connectivity:

```bash
ping 8.8.8.8
```

Verify DNS resolution:

```bash
ping google.com
```

---

# SSH Configuration

OpenSSH Server was installed during the Ubuntu installation process to allow secure remote administration.

Verify that the SSH service is running:

```bash
sudo systemctl status ssh
```

Display the server IP address:

```bash
hostname -I
```

Connect remotely from another computer:

```bash
ssh aidan@192.168.50.101
```

---

# Validation

The installation was verified by confirming:

* Ubuntu Server booted successfully.
* Administrative login completed successfully.
* Network connectivity was established.
* Internet access was available.
* DNS resolution functioned correctly.
* System packages were successfully updated.
* SSH service was running and accepting remote connections.

---

# Troubleshooting

## No Internet Connection

* Verify the virtual network adapter is connected to the correct Proxmox bridge.
* Confirm DHCP or static IP settings.
* Verify the default gateway.

---

## DNS Resolution Fails

Verify the configured DNS server:

```bash
cat /etc/resolv.conf
```

Test external connectivity:

```bash
ping 8.8.8.8
```

If the IP responds but domain names do not, verify the DNS configuration.

---

## SSH Connection Failed

Verify that SSH is running:

```bash
sudo systemctl status ssh
```

If necessary, start the service:

```bash
sudo systemctl start ssh
```
